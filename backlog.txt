**FUTURE**
IETS MET
- Overlopen of niet: Zit ik aan m'n max of is er ruimte
- Niet uren, maar percentage van de week

MWAH - Gefactureerde uren uitdrukken als percentage gewerkte uren
MWAH - Tot nu toe gefactueerde uren uitdrukken als percentage beschikbare uren
MWAH - Expliciet melden wanneer uren opzet obv "nog niet ingepland" als Sport Science Centre uren

- Iets doen met "hours_cap": Projectoverzicht tabellen ordenen op percentage hours_cap? Kleur geven als 80% (oranje) en 100% (rood) is overschreden?
- Add a "Closed Projects" tab that summarizes the closed projects, including a visual of what was delivered (which I need to come up with a workflo for. Perhaps add a folder "deliverables" to each project folder? Or products. Perhaps braintstorm a bit about this..

Ideetjes om rapportage te verbeteren:
-> prioritering printen zodat ik weet waar ik aan moet werken?

- Make "per theme" plot a word cloud



**IN PROGRESS**


**DONE**


**COMMITTED**
- Percentage should show percentages relative to total hours reported (so far) in that period. Previously I mistakenly suggested that the sum of all bars in a plot should be 100%. This is not true, because some plots visualize multiple tags that can map to the same tickets (i.e., hours worked).
This is the case for "Hours per programma", "Hours per theme" and "Hours per requester".
For the "Report hours per project" it shouldn't matter as hours worked maps one-on-one to project.

As for the timeseries plot ("Estimated magnitude per week" and "Reported hours per week"), they should still be plotted so the sum of all plotted values is 100%. However, the range of the y-axis should be fixed from 0 to 10% above the max stacked value that occurs.

- Update formatting of finished projects
-> Opacity: Alleen actieve projecten volle kleur (al gedaan?)
-> Stacking order (finished sink to bottom)
-> Hover: states status and end date

BUG FIXED -> Looks like there is a bug in timeseries plot for Month. It shows same hours every week but it should be aggregated at week level so each week should show different number of hours. Similarly, the year to date plot also doesn't have different hours per week.
- Next to Counts and Hours, create a third option called "Percentage". It should be almost like a copy of the "Hours" tab, but instead of showing the absolute hours on the vertical axis, it should show the percentage. The total is always all the hours that are plotted in a plot. So the plots will look exactly like the hours plots, but will have the precentage on the vertical axis. The sum of all plotted bars in a single plot should always be 100.
- In the percentage tab, update the table in the 1- and 2-weeks overview that shows the logged hours by project. Update it to reflect percentage as well, all with respect to the total number of hours logged during that time period.


- Reorganize buttoning. 
-> If Month is selected, fold-out an extra row of buttons showing all completed months, by default selecting the most recently finished month, but allowing the user to also select months further in the past.
-> Rename the button "Year" to "Year (to-date)"

- Add some more rspacing between plots to make sure labels don't overlap
- Tabular showing hours with no decimals (unnecessary precision)
- In the weekly and biweekly report, add a tabular display of the logged hours for that week aggregated by project sorted by the project on which I spent the most hours. Add a unfold/fold functionality to expand each project to see which specific entries were made. this should show "WhatIDid" and "duration_hours" and should also be sorted by duration_hours.


- Generate one file
- Add biweekly report.

- Pie chart
- Timeseries fix

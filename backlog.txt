**FUTURE**
IETS MET
- Overlopen of niet: Zit ik aan m'n max of is er ruimte
- Niet uren, maar percentage van de week

MWAH - Gefactureerde uren uitdrukken als percentage gewerkte uren
MWAH - Tot nu toe gefactueerde uren uitdrukken als percentage beschikbare uren
MWAH - Expliciet melden wanneer uren opzet obv "nog niet ingepland" als Sport Science Centre uren

- Iets doen met "hours_cap": Projectoverzicht tabellen ordenen op percentage hours_cap? Kleur geven als 80% (oranje) en 100% (rood) is overschreden?
- Add a "Closed Projects" tab that summarizes the closed projects, including a visual of what was delivered (which I need to come up with a workflo for. Perhaps add a folder "deliverables" to each project folder? Or products. Perhaps braintstorm a bit about this..

Ideetjes om rapportage te verbeteren:
-> prioritering printen zodat ik weet waar ik aan moet werken?

- Make "per theme" plot a word cloud



**IN PROGRESS** 
** DELAYED BECAUSE OF NON-FUNCTIONING CODEX **
Each project folder now also contains a folder "Deliverables" containing a readme.txt which contains the following text:
"In this "Deliverables" folder you can put files that showcase what was delivered for this project.
Image (.png) and text files (.txt) will be shown in the dashboard.
Any other files will not be shown in the project overview dashboard, but can of course be stored here for convenience."
- Check whether each project folder has a Deliverables folder (readme.txt doesn't necessarily have to be there), if not, throw a human readable error.
- For each folder, read the .png and .txt (except readme.txt) files and keep them in memory so they can be used in the overview

- Update the project overview
-> Create a new Projects page
--> Move the tabular project overview from the bottom of the page to a designated "Projects" page (see reoganization of buttons instruction below)
--> Rather than showing the complete projects table for each project, initially just show the project title. Once the user clicks on the title, the table should unfold and become visible
--> Rather than showing the projects next to each other horizontally, the projects should now be listed vertically
--> If available, the .txt files in the "Deliverables" should be shown next to the tabular information once the user clicks on a project and unfolds the project information
--> Similarly, any .png files should be shown next to that as well

-> Reorganize buttons: 
--> Add a "Projects" button on the same level as "Counts", "Hours" and "Percentage".
--> Whenever Counts, Hours or Percentage is selected, the second row should remain to be 1-week, 2-weeks, Month and Year (to-date).
--> Whenever "Projects" is selected, the second row should allow the user to filter at least based on status (Proposed, Active, On-hold, Closed, Cancelled or "all") but preferably also based on Priority, estimated_magnitude and even programma (if multiple, separate by |)
--> Show tabular project overview on this page and make sure the second row of buttons (to filter) is functional



**DONE**


**COMMITTED**
- Percentage should show percentages relative to total hours reported (so far) in that period. Previously I mistakenly suggested that the sum of all bars in a plot should be 100%. This is not true, because some plots visualize multiple tags that can map to the same tickets (i.e., hours worked).
This is the case for "Hours per programma", "Hours per theme" and "Hours per requester".
For the "Report hours per project" it shouldn't matter as hours worked maps one-on-one to project.

As for the timeseries plot ("Estimated magnitude per week" and "Reported hours per week"), they should still be plotted so the sum of all plotted values is 100%. However, the range of the y-axis should be fixed from 0 to 10% above the max stacked value that occurs.

- Update formatting of finished projects
-> Opacity: Alleen actieve projecten volle kleur (al gedaan?)
-> Stacking order (finished sink to bottom)
-> Hover: states status and end date

BUG FIXED -> Looks like there is a bug in timeseries plot for Month. It shows same hours every week but it should be aggregated at week level so each week should show different number of hours. Similarly, the year to date plot also doesn't have different hours per week.
- Next to Counts and Hours, create a third option called "Percentage". It should be almost like a copy of the "Hours" tab, but instead of showing the absolute hours on the vertical axis, it should show the percentage. The total is always all the hours that are plotted in a plot. So the plots will look exactly like the hours plots, but will have the precentage on the vertical axis. The sum of all plotted bars in a single plot should always be 100.
- In the percentage tab, update the table in the 1- and 2-weeks overview that shows the logged hours by project. Update it to reflect percentage as well, all with respect to the total number of hours logged during that time period.


- Reorganize buttoning. 
-> If Month is selected, fold-out an extra row of buttons showing all completed months, by default selecting the most recently finished month, but allowing the user to also select months further in the past.
-> Rename the button "Year" to "Year (to-date)"

- Add some more rspacing between plots to make sure labels don't overlap
- Tabular showing hours with no decimals (unnecessary precision)
- In the weekly and biweekly report, add a tabular display of the logged hours for that week aggregated by project sorted by the project on which I spent the most hours. Add a unfold/fold functionality to expand each project to see which specific entries were made. this should show "WhatIDid" and "duration_hours" and should also be sorted by duration_hours.


- Generate one file
- Add biweekly report.

- Pie chart
- Timeseries fix
